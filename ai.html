      <h1>An Overview of Artificial Intelligence Accelerators</h1>

        This showcases the introduction section of a term paper I wrote for a
        graduate level computer architecture course. The full article can be

        Artificial Intelligence is that branch of computer science that deals
        with the development of computer systems that emulate cognitive behavior
        to simulate complex abilities such as perception of vision, recognition
        of speech, logical deduction, reasoning, etc. The scientific work that
        can now be recognized as the earliest example of the demonstration of
        artificial intelligence fundamentals is the McCulloh and Pitts (1943)
        artificial neuron that characterized a formal turing complete design.
        Today, this technology is ubiquitous and intimately intertwined with the
        human experience. The salient ideas of artificial intelligence and
        associated fields have been here for more than 50 years. But despite the
        obvious utility of this technology their use only become prominent in
        everyday life in the past decade.
      </p>
      <p>
        This latency can be attributed, in part, to the lack of computer
        infrastructure equipped to deal with the massive amount of processing
        power required by artificial neural networks to generate useful results.
        Thus, while algorithmic innovations were at the center of the AI
        revolution, one of the most important contributors to the success of the
        field was the improvements in the underlying architecture capable of
        performing the required calculations, given algorithmic constraints. For
        instance, it is a widely held belief that the research work titled
        Alexnet as presented by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey
        Hinton (2017) from the University of Toronto rang in a new era for the
        AI community. They utilized a specialized hardware unit - the GPU to
        compute the neural network more time efficiently. While their algorithm
        itself was not revolutionary, their creation of an innovative mapping of
        the convolution operations set their solution apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, without the ability to learn complex data relations in a
        reasonable time frame - a capability imparted because of the improvement
        in the way the networks are computed - we would perhaps not have seen
        such widespread adoption of AI techniques, useful as they may be.
        Changing the way in which an AI algorithm is implemented makes the
        algorithm run more efficiently and saves time especially when it comes
        to massive real-life computations. An example of this can be
        demonstrated by taking the case of matrix multiplication - a ubiquitous
        operation in AI. In Figure 1 we see how using different computation
        methods to perform this operation can help improve processor
        performance.

        This is where AI accelerators come into play. An artificial intelligence
        accelerator may be defined as a high-efficiency computing device that is
        capable of handling large-scale neural network workloads due to its
        specialized design and parallel processing capabilities. These are
        specialized hardware units present in computer systems that help speed
        up AI operations by virtue of the highly specific nature of their
        architecture.
      </p>

      <p>
        They are a special category of hardware accelerators - processors that
        are designed to increase the efficiency of the CPU by taking away some
        of the specialized task load. This helps in increasing the performance
        of the computer and the efficiency with which the task is executed.
        Hardware accelerators combine the flexibility that is afforded by the
        presence of general-purpose CPUs with the performance efficiency that
        specialized hardware offers to optimize task performance. A few examples
        of processors being used as AI accelerators are GPU or graphical
        processing units that are most adept at dealing with parallelized
        processing of massive amounts of data. Other devices include FPGAs or
        field programmable gate arrays and ASICs or application-specific
        integrated circuits.

        In this article, a comprehensive survey of the field of artificial
        intelligence accelerators has been undertaken. The first section
        highlights the pivotal role these specialized processors have played in
        the progress of the field of artificial intelligence. Following this,
        the evolution of computer processors and the advancements that brought
        about the need for the development of accelerators has been traced.
        Further, a detailed discussion of the major categories of AI
        accelerators has been conducted. The last two sections of the article
        present a detailed overview of the various leading industry processors
        that are driving innovations in the field of AI and summarise the
        general industry trends prevalent.
